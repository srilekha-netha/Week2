## Week2
### Day2_Prompt_Engineering
#### Task1_ZeroShot_vs_FewShot
**Objective:**  
Understand the difference between zero-shot and few-shot prompting in LLMs.
**Description:**  
- **Zero-shot prompting**: Provided the model with only the instruction, no examples.  
- **Few-shot prompting**: Provided the model with a few examples before the task instruction.  
- Compared outputs to analyze performance differences.

#### Task2_Role_Based_CoT
**Objective:**  
Learn how role-based and chain-of-thought prompting improve response quality.
**Description:**  
- **Role-based prompting**: Assigned a specific role to the model to get contextually aligned answers.  
- **Chain-of-Thought prompting**: Asked the model to think step-by-step for better reasoning.  
- Tested on both creative and reasoning-based tasks.

### Day3_Running_OpenSource_LLM
#### Task1_TextClassification_Summarization
# ðŸ“° News Summarizer with Highlights
## ðŸ“Œ Description
This Streamlit application allows users to paste any news article and instantly get:
1. **A concise AI-generated summary** using a Hugging Face `t5-small` summarization model.
2. **Key highlights** (Named Entities) extracted using the `dslim/bert-base-NER` model, grouped by type (e.g., PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION).

The app leverages **PyTorch** for hardware acceleration and automatically runs on **GPU** if available for faster processing.
